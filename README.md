# XPlatformer-Workspace

## Summary

A meta-repository for facilitating development of the many-repository XPlatformer project.

## Getting Started

XPlatformer-Workspace is a git-submodules oriented approach for dealing with the multiple repositories of the XPlatformer project (XPlatformer / XGameLib / XSamples). The project provides all the repositories in one, using vagrant-desktop to provide an X11 development environment. You can clone all the repositories using the `--recursive` directive of git as such:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@gitlab:.../XPlatformer-Workspace.git
```

Or if the repository has already been cloned, you can use:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Usage

The `Workspace` architecture aims to provide a way of provisioning a complete environment for working with multiple repositories. The desired architecture of the meta-project is specified below:

```bash
* Repository
    * bin
    * lib
    * build
        * build-all.sh
        * ...
    * Repositories
        * [r] XPlatformer (git@gitlab/XPlatformer.git)
        * [r] XGameLib (git@gitlab/XGameLib.git)
        * ...
    * Environments
        * [r] vagrant-desktop-x11 (git@gitlab/vagrant-desktop-x11.git)
    * ...
    * README.md
```

The `XPlatformer-Workspace` is a modified version of the proposed architecture where the environments and repositories directories are merged. This is done to simplify the working environment.
